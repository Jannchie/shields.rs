# shields.rs

A high-performance badge rendering engine written in Rust, supporting SVG output and font parsing. This project is designed for developers and services that require fast, customizable, and reliable badge generation.

**ðŸŽ¯ Pixel-Perfect Consistency with shields.io**

Our goal is to achieve pixel-perfect, 100% identical rendering results to [shields.io](https://shields.io/). We utilize precisely the same text length calculation data to ensure full consistency, while delivering significantly improved efficiency.

## Usage Example

The library provides a chainable API for customizing badges. You can set the label, message, color, and other properties using method chaining:

```rust
use shields::Badge;

fn main() {
    let svg = Badge::new()
        .set_label("build")
        .set_message("passing")
        .render();
    std::fs::write("badge.svg", svg).unwrap();
}
```
