A high-performance badge rendering engine written in Rust, supporting SVG output and font parsing. This project is designed for developers and services that require fast, customizable, and reliable badge generation.

**ðŸŽ¯ Pixel-Perfect Consistency with shields.io**

Our goal is to achieve pixel-perfect, 100% identical rendering results to [shields.io](https://shields.io/). We utilize precisely the same text length calculation data to ensure full consistency, while delivering significantly improved efficiency.

**ðŸŸ¢ Bitwise-Identical SVG Output**

Not only do we pursue pixel-level similarity, but we also guarantee that the generated SVG string is bitwise-identical to the output returned by shields.io for the same parameters. This ensures absolute compatibility and consistency for all use cases.

**ðŸŽ¨ Supported Styles**

We support all major badge styles: `flat`, `flat-square`, `plastic`, `social` and `for-the-badge`. Each style can be customized with various properties such as label, message, color, logo, and more.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (edition 2024 or later)
- Cargo package manager (comes with Rust)

## Usage Example

The library provides a chainable API for customizing badges. You can set the label, message, color, and other properties using method chaining:

```rust
use shields::builder::Badge;

fn main() {
    // Simple flat badge
    let badge = Badge::flat().label("test").message("passing").build();
    println!("{}", badge);
    // Flat badge with custom colors
    let badge = Badge::plastic()
        .label("version")
        .message("1.0.0")
        .label_color("#555")
        .message_color("#4c1")
        .build();
    println!("{}", badge);
    // Plastic badge with logo
    let badge = Badge::social()
        .label("github")
        .message("stars")
        .logo("github")
        .link("https://github.com/user/repo")
        .extra_link("https://github.com/user/repo/stargazers")
        .build();
    println!("{}", badge);
}
```
