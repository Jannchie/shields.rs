A high-performance badge rendering engine written in Rust, supporting SVG output and font parsing. This project is designed for developers and services that require fast, customizable, and reliable badge generation.

**üü¢ Bitwise-Identical SVG Output**

Not only do we pursue pixel-level similarity, but we also guarantee that the generated SVG string is bitwise-identical to the output returned by shields.io for the same parameters. This ensures absolute compatibility and consistency for all use cases.

**‚ö°Ô∏è Fast & Efficient**

Over 10x faster than the Node.js badge-maker library, this Rust implementation is optimized for speed and efficiency. It can generate badges in microseconds, making it suitable for high-performance applications and services.

**üé® Supported All Styles & Logos**

We support all major badge styles: `flat`, `flat-square`, `plastic`, `social` and `for-the-badge`. Each style can be customized with various properties such as label, message, color, logo, and more. You can easily use [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/?q=5) slugs to set logos for your badges, and we also support custom logos with SVG strings.

## Benchmark: Rust vs Node.js badge-maker

| Library     | Language | Time per badge | Unit |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------- | ---- |
| shields     | Rust     | 4.4796         | ¬µs   |
| badge-maker | Node.js  | 49.5232        | ¬µs   |

## Installation

```bash
cargo add shields
```

## Usage Example

The library provides a chainable API for customizing badges. You can set the label, message, color, and other properties using method chaining:

```rust
use shields::builder::Badge;

fn main() {
    // Simple flat badge
    let badge = Badge::flat().label("test").message("passing").build();
    println!("{}", badge);
    // Flat badge with custom colors
    let badge = Badge::plastic()
        .label("version")
        .message("1.0.0")
        .label_color("#555")
        .message_color("#4c1")
        .build();
    println!("{}", badge);
    // Plastic badge with logo
    let badge = Badge::social()
        .label("github")
        .message("stars")
        .logo("github")
        .link("https://github.com/user/repo")
        .extra_link("https://github.com/user/repo/stargazers")
        .build();
    println!("{}", badge);
}
```
